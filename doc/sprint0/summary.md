# Summary

**The Project Objective:**

* Our objective is to build a recipe web app that users can use to search for the recipe of their next meal. It will have a database that contains recommended and well-reviewed/curated/reputable recipes and will allow users to search for specific recipes using filters such as by main ingredient, by cuisine, and by dietary restrictions. The application will also integrate YouTube videos into our web app, allowing people to find videos showcasing recipes related to their search and recommended channels.

**The Key Users:**

* Home cooks: People who want to search up recipes for their next meal  
* Chefs: professionals who want to learn specific cuisines, how to create recipes with dietary restrictions, or research a new recipe to learn.  
* Food lovers: someone looking to save recipes, explore different foods, or find new videos and cuisines to try. 

**The Key Scenarios:**

* Searching recipes: Users will search for recipes with filters to focus results by various preferences.  
* Finding suggested/recommended recipes: Recommend recipes based on previously viewed by user or user preferences/history.  
* Watching recipe related videos: View related Youtube cooking videos of the recipe being viewed, which will act as a video tutorial and allow them to have a visual guide.  
* Homepage video recommendations: User will see a list of YouTube channels recommended by the team followed by a list of a couple of their most recent videos, allowing them to possibly find a recipe that may interest them

**The Principles:**

* Easy to use and intuitive design  
* Helpful and provides a greater cooking experience for the user.
