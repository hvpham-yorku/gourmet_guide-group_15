**Standard Definition of Done** 

1. Code Implementation:  
   * Code has been written to fulfill the user story’s acceptance criteria.  
   * The feature or functionality works as expected, with no known bugs preventing the feature from working as intended.  
2. Unit Testing:  
   * Unit tests have been written for any core functionality, and these tests cover both positive and negative cases.  
   * The code passes all relevant unit tests.  
3. Integration Testing:  
   * If applicable, the feature integrates correctly with other parts of the system (e.g., database, third-party services like YouTube API).  
   * No issues occur during the integration phase, such as broken links, UI misalignment, or failed interactions.  
4. Acceptance Criteria:  
   * All acceptance criteria defined in the user story are met.  
   * The feature is demoed with the user story’s acceptance criteria covered in the demonstration.  
5. Code Review:  
   * The code has been reviewed by at least one team member other than the original developer.  
   * The code adheres to the team’s coding standards, including naming conventions, documentation, and clarity.  
6. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX):  
   * The UI matches the design mockups and wireframes provided by the team (or stakeholders).  
   * The user interface is intuitive, responsive, and accessible (e.g., supports screen readers, is mobile-friendly).  
7. Documentation:  
   * Documentation has been updated to reflect the changes (e.g., technical documentation, comments in the code, user-facing documentation).  
   * Any new user-facing features or settings (such as new filters or search options) are documented.  
8. Bug Free:  
   * There are no high-priority or medium-priority bugs remaining for the feature.  
   * Known bugs are logged in the bug tracker, and if they cannot be fixed in the current sprint, they are prioritized for the next sprint.  
9. Performance Testing:  
   * The feature performs as expected, with no noticeable degradation in performance (e.g., loading times, search times).  
   * Any relevant performance metrics, such as page load times, are within acceptable thresholds.  
10. Deployment & Environment:  
    * The feature is tested in a staging environment and is confirmed to work in both staging and production.  
    * Any dependencies (e.g., YouTube API, database changes) have been tested and verified.  
    * The feature is ready for deployment with no outstanding issues.  
11. User Feedback/Stakeholder Approval:  
    * The feature has been demonstrated to stakeholders, and feedback has been addressed.  
    * The product owner or designated stakeholders have approved the feature.  
12. Done Is "Shippable":  
    * The feature is in a state that it could be shipped or deployed at any time without any further major work needed.  
    * The product is in a stable and functional state after implementation

**Additional Definitions of Done**   
These additional items help refine the DoD for specific scenarios or feature types:

1. Recipe AI Generator:  
   * The AI generator can generate valid recipes based on user input.  
   * User inputs ingredients, and the AI suggests appropriate recipes with detailed instructions and quantities.  
   * The AI’s recommendations are contextually appropriate (e.g., dietary preferences, allergies).  
2. Ingredient Availability Feature:  
   * The feature to suggest recipes based on available ingredients works, with relevant substitutions where necessary.  
   * Users can easily input their ingredients, and the platform returns accurate results.  
3. YouTube Integration:  
   * The YouTube API integration works smoothly, and related videos appear for each recipe.  
   * Videos load correctly, and users can watch them without being redirected from the recipe page.  
4. Push Notifications:  
   * Push notifications work as expected, delivering relevant alerts based on user preferences (e.g., new recipe uploads, updates to saved recipes).  
   * Users can enable or disable notifications in their settings, and notifications are timely and relevant.  
5. Search and Filter Functionality:  
   * Filters (ingredients, cuisine types, dietary preferences, etc.) work and return the correct set of recipes based on the selected filters.  
   * Searching by keyword or ingredient returns accurate results with matching recipes.  
6. User Authentication:  
   * Users can successfully register, log in, and access personalized features like saved recipes.  
   * Authentication issues (e.g., forgotten password) are handled appropriately.
