**Process**

* How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?  
  * We organized through discord, where we created dedicated channels for tasks, discussions, and general communication  
  * Each member was assigned specific roles based on personal strengths and knowledge  
    * Product owner  
    * Backend and Frontend developers  
    * Quality Assurance and Scrum Master  
* How did you make decisions?  
  * We made decisions based on everyone's opinion.  
  * If anyone had an idea they would present it to the group and we would give input regarding it.  
  * If we were able to come to a conclusion then as a group we would move forward with that idea.  
  * For example, when determining which features to prioritize, we analyzed their importance to users and voted to reach a consensus. This collaborative process allowed us to ensure that all perspectives were considered.  
* How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?   
  * We based the priority of user stories on how necessary it is for our project, user experience, feasibility, and how dependent features are on one another.  
  * If it is something that is someone felt was vital then we assigned it more priority  
  * Together as a group we would decide a storyâ€™s priority and ensured each member was on the same page.   
* How frequently did you meet?  
  * We met twice a week for sprint planning and check-ins, all organized through Discord.   
  * Our meetings focused on progress updates, identifying blockers, and ensuring alignment with the project goals.   
  * We also set aside time to work through problems together and review any ideas/decisions/plans for the sprint.  
* What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?  
  * For the next phase, we plan to streamline our decision-making process even further. Although our current approach works well, some decisions took more time than necessary, and we aim to reduce those delays.  
  * We also plan to improve the task division and priority through trello and planning, there were times where tasks were left open and by improving our process we will be able to increase efficiency.
