New User stories:

-   Filtering Search Results/Database: As a user I should be able to filter my search results or filter when browsing recipes to only get recipes that meet my dietary restrictions, time requirements, cuisine preferences and ingredients.
-   Criteria for satisfaction: Button when searching or browsing recipes that will drop down and allow users to only see results based on what they input for the following fields: dietary restrictions(vegan, vegetarian, etc. ), time to make, type of cuisine(chinese, indian, fast food, etc.), ingredients(onions, lettuce, salt, etc.).
-   Pleasant Website UI: As a user I should be able to navigate the website without hurting my eyes, and be able to intuitively and easily navigate and engage with the site.
-   Criteria for Satisfaction: The website should be split into pages with a home page for core features like searching and recommendations and everything else should be in a separate page which is linked with a simple nav bar to make navigation easy.

What are practices that you should continue during next sprint

-   Regular stand-up meetings to ensure everyone stays aligned on progress and blockers.
-   Using Trello for task tracking and progress updates, as it kept everyone organized.
-   Peer programming sessions for complex issues, which improved collaboration and problem-solving.
-   Testing and reviewing code before pushing to the main branch, reducing bugs.

What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint

-   Implementing sprint planning with more detailed task breakdowns to avoid ambiguity.
-   Allocating a buffer day at the end of the sprint for testing and polish.
-   Introducing time-boxing for meetings to ensure they stay focused and productive.
-   Using a shared calendar to better coordinate team availability and deadlines.

What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint

-   Overloading team members with too many tasks, leading to burnout.
-   Ignoring technical debt; we need to allocate time to clean up the codebase.
-   Rushing last-minute features into the sprint without properly scoping them.
-   Avoiding asking for help early when facing blockers, which delays progress.

What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1

-   Best experience: Successfully integrating a new feature (e.g., a text-to-speech functionality) and seeing it work as expected. The collaborative debugging process was very rewarding\!
-   Worst experience: Dealing with merge conflicts right before the sprint deadline, which caused unnecessary stress. It highlighted the need for more frequent merges.
