**Release Goal**  
Objective: Deliver a minimum viable product (MVP) that allows users to search for recipes, and apply filters, and browse categories.

**Project Scope**  
Key Features (Epics):

-   Epic 1: Recipe recommendation system based on history
    -   User Story: As a returning user, I want to see recipe recommendations based on my search history, so I can discover new recipes that match my interests.
    -   Criteria for Satisfaction: A recommendation section displays recipes related to previous searches or filters used by the user.
-   Epic 2: User authentication
    -   User Story: As a new user, I want to create an account and log in, so I can access personalized features like saving recipes and receiving recommendations.
    -   Criteria for Satisfaction: Users can register with an email and password or through a social media account, and they can log in to access their profile, saved recipes, and recommendations.
-   Epic 3: Recipe AI generator
    -   User Story: As a user, I want to generate a recipe based on specific ingredients I have, so I can create a new dish when I'm unsure what to cook.
    -   Criteria for Satisfaction: The user inputs available ingredients, and the system generates a list of recipe ideas, with ingredient quantities and instructions.
-   Epic 4: Allow Users to search for recipes
    -   User Story: As a user, I want to be able to browse and search for specific recipes I am looking for Ideally I would want to search for a recipe that meets my needs and wants eg.(dietary restrictions, ingredients preferences)
    -   Criteria for Satisfaction: The user inputs either a specific prompt to search for a recipe and the system returns most relevant entries or a user sets filters for dietary restrictions, preparation time, ingredients etc. and the system returns all entries in the filter.
-   Epic 5: Recipes Database
    -   User Story: As a user, I want to browse a catalog of highly reviewed recipes displayed in a visually appealing layout with key details like an image, title, and rating, to draw inspiration without needing specific filters. I also want the option to contribute by adding my own recipes to the database and have optional sorting and filtering features for efficiency.
    -   Criteria for Satisfaction: The recipe database should allow users to browse highly reviewed recipes in an organized and visually appealing layout, showcasing details like images, titles, and ratings. Users should also have the ability to contribute their own recipes and access optional sorting and filtering features for a more tailored browsing experience.
