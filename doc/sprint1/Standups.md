**Nov 19, 2024 \- Sprint 1 Standup 1**

1. **What did you work on since the last standup?**  
   This is the first standup since Sprint 0\. During Sprint 0, we established the project vision, identified key features, and created user stories. Since then, we have focused on research and resource gathering. Key activities include:
    - Exploring additional recipe APIs.
    - Researching suitable AI models.
    - Learning React, CSS, Express, RESTful APIs, and Axios to prepare for development.
2. **What do you commit to next?**  
   Our team will split into four groups to focus on these tasks:
    - Main Page UI: Create a basic template for the main page.
    - Navigation Bar: Develop a React-based navbar (initially a template or fully functional with links).
    - Search Engine Backend & Frontend: Write code to make HTTP request to backend, which will make an API request to third-party recipe API and send paginated data back to frontend, where the frontend will handle the response and display it.
    - Dietary Filter Backend: Build functionality to filter recipes based on user-input dietary restrictions, using a database or hardcoded examples initially.  
      These tasks are part of implementing our two main features (dietary filters and search engine) and creating placeholder landing pages to get the site functional.
3. **When do you think you'll be done?**  
   These tasks are expected to be completed by the next sprint date. However, tasks 3 (search engine) and 4 (dietary filters) may require more extensive work and will continue in smaller increments.
4. **Do you have any blockers?**
    - The dietary filter functionality is dependent on the recipe database and search engine integration. However, we can proceed with hardcoded examples for testing purposes.

**Nov 20, 2024 \- Sprint 1 Standup 2**

1. **What did you work on since the last standup?**
    - Designed the main page UI.
    - Developed a basic navbar template (currently not linked to pages).
    - Created a search engine page that can make API calls (UI design and API output processing are still in progress).
    - Began working on dietary filter functionality.
2. **What do you commit to next?**
    - Continue developing the search engine, focusing on processing API outputs.
    - Refine the UI for the search engine page.
    - Link the navbar to appropriate pages.
    - Create basic landing pages for future features (e.g., AI, sign-in, recipe database).
3. **When do you think you'll be done?**  
   Most of these tasks should be completed by the next standup.
4. **Do you have any blockers?**  
   No major blockers identified at this time.

**Nov 21, 2024 \- Sprint 1 Standup 3**

1. **What did you work on since the last standup?**
    - Completed the search engine functionality, enabling query submissions, API calls, and output processing for users.
    - Finalized dietary filters for sorting API results.
    - Completed basic home and search page UI.
    - Designed AI landing page UI.
    - Created placeholder landing pages for sign-in and recipe database features.
    - Made the navbar fully functional and improved its UI.
2. **What do you commit to next?**
    - Planning the next set of features to be developed in the upcoming sprint.
    - Clean up and refine the UI for all features implemented in this sprint, and further develop the remaining functionality for them
    - Developing backend connection to our database to implement features requiring persistent data, such as user profiles and their saved recipe collections, and improving API call performance by introducing a cache
3. **When do you think you'll be done?**  
   These tasks are expected to be completed by the sprint deadline.
4. **Do you have any blockers?**  
   No significant blockers at this stage; just ensuring all current features integrate seamlessly into the UI.
